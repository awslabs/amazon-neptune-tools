# Example label mapping and filtering configuration for Neo4j to Neptune conversion
# This file demonstrates how to map vertex and edge labels and skip certain records during conversion

# Vertex id transformation configuration
vertexIdTransformation:
  ~id: "{_labels}_{born}_{name}_{releases}_{tagline}_{title}_{_id}"

# Edge id transformation configuration
# You can use {_from} or {~from} to reference the transformed source vertex ID
# You can use {_to} or {~to} to reference the transformed target vertex ID
edgeIdTransformation:
  ~id: "{_start}!{_end}!{_type}!{~from}!{~to}!{~label}!{_id}"
