# Export Neptune to ElasticSearch

The [Neptune Full-Text Search](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune/latest/userguide/full-text-search-cfn-create.html) CloudFormation templates provide a mechanism for indexing all _new_ data that is added to an Amazon Neptune database in ElasticSearch. However, there are situations in which you may want to index _existing_ data in a Neptune database prior to enabling the full-text search integration.

This solution allows you to index existing data in an Amazon Neptune database in ElasticSearch _before_ enabling Neptune's full-text search integration.

Once you have populated ElasticSearch with your existing Neptune data, you can remove this solution from your account.

### Prerequisites

Before provisioning the solution ensure the following conditions are met:
  
  - You have an existing Neptune cluster and an existing ElasticSearch cluster in the same VPC
  - ElasticSearch is version 7.1 or above
  - You have at least one subnet with a route to the internet:
    - Either, a subnet with the __Auto-assign public IPv4 address__ set to __Yes__, a route table with a route destination of __0.0.0.0/0__, and an internet gateway set to __Target__ (for example, __igw-1a2b3c4d__).
    - Or, a subnet with the __Auto-assign public IPv4 address__ set to __No__, a route table with a route destination of __0.0.0.0/0__, and a NAT gateway set to __Target__ (for example, __nat-12345678901234567__). For more details, see [Routing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Scenario2.html#VPC_Scenario2_Routinghttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Scenario2.html#VPC_Scenario2_Routing).
  - You have VPC security groups that can be used to access your Neptune and ElasticSearch clusters.
    
This solution uses [_neptune-export_](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-neptune-tools/tree/master/neptune-export) to export data from your Neptune database. We recommend using _neptune-export_ against a static version of your data. Either suspend writes to your database while the export is taking place, or run the export against a [snapshot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune/latest/userguide/backup-restore-create-snapshot.html) or [clone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune/latest/userguide/manage-console-cloning.html) of your database.

_neptune-export_ uses long-running queries to get data from Neptune. You may need to increase the __neptune_query_timeout__ [DB parameter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune/latest/userguide/parameters.html) in order to run the export solution against large datasets.

The export process uses SSL to connect to Neptune. It currently supports IAM Database Authentication for Gremlin, but not SPARQL.

### Solution overview

![Export Neptune to ElasticSearch](export-neptune-to-elasticsearch.png)

  1. You trigger the export process via an AWS Lambda Function
  2. The export process uses AWS Batch to host and execute _neptune-export_, which exports data from Neptune and publishes it to an Amazon Kinesis Data Stream in the [Neptune Streams format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune/latest/userguide/streams-change-formats.html).
  3. A second AWS Lambda function polls the Kinesis Stream and publishes records to your Amazon ElasticSearch cluster. This function uses the same parsing and publishing code as the Neptune Streams ElasticSearch integration solution.
  
### Exporting from a Database Clone

If you want to [clone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune/latest/userguide/manage-console-cloning.html) your database before exporting, you can add a `--clone-cluster` flag, either to the __AdditionalParams__ CloudFormation parameter when you install the solution, or to the __ADDITIONAL_PARAMS___ environment variable of the _export-neptune-to-kinesis_ AWS Lambda function once the solution has been installed.

### Handling Large Properties

As noted in the solution overview, this solution exports data from Neptune and publishes it to an Amazon Kinesis Data Stream in the [Neptune Streams format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune/latest/userguide/streams-change-formats.html). Each record published to Kinesis comprises a JSON document containing an array of Neptune Streams change records that represent the labels and properties of a single vertex or edge. A vertex with a single label and two properties, for example, would be published to Kinesis as an array of three Neptune Streams change records.

The maximum size of a data payload of a [Kinesis record is 1 MB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html). Therefore, a vertex or edge with a set of properties whose array of Neptune Streams change records totals more than 1 MB in size will fail to be published to Kinesis. And obviously, any single property whose value exceeds 1 MB will similarly fail.

_neptune-export_ provides a configuration option, `--`, that allows you to control how large properties and collections of properties whose size exceeds 1 MB are handled. By default, this configuration uses the `splitAndShred` strategy, which ensures that all properties, irrespective of their size, are published successfully to Kinesis, and thereafter indexed in ElasticSearch.

  - `dropAll` - If the array of Neptune Streams change records for a vertex or edge exceeds 1 MB, all records for that vertex or edge will be dropped.
  - `splitAndDrop` – The array of Neptune Streams change records for a vertex or edge is split and the individual records submitted to Kinesis. Any individual property record whose size exceeds 1 MB, however, will be dropped.
  - `splitAndShred` – The array of Neptune Streams change records for a vertex or edge is split and the individual records submitted to Kinesis. Any individual property record whose size exceeds 1 MB is then further split into multiple records, each up 1 MB in size. These records are then submitted to Kinesis. 

If you want to change the large property handling strategy, you can add a `--clone-cluster` parameter, either to the __AdditionalParams__ CloudFormation parameter when you install the solution, or to the __ADDITIONAL_PARAMS___ environment variable of the _export-neptune-to-kinesis_ AWS Lambda function once the solution has been installed. For example:

```
-- splitAndDrop
```
    
### Installation

  1. Launch the [Neptune-to-ElasticSearch CloudFormation stack](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-neptune-tools/blob/master/export-neptune-to-elasticsearch/cloudformation-templates/export-neptune-to-elasticsearch.json) for your Region from the table below.
  
  2. Once the stack has been provisioned, open a terminal and run the __StartExportCommand__ AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) command from the CloudFormation output. For example:

     ```
     aws lambda invoke \
       --function-name arn:aws:lambda:eu-west-1:000000000000:function:export-neptune-to-kinesis-xxxx \
       --region eu-west-1 \
       /dev/stdout
     ```
     
     The function returns the name and ID of an AWS Batch job that begins the export from Neptune.
     
  3. Once you have successfully populated ElasticSearch with existing data in your Neptune database, you can remove this solution from your account by deleting the CloudFormation stack.

### Monitoring and troubleshooting

To diagnose issues with the export from Neptune to Kinesis, consult the Amazon CloudWatch logs for your AWS Batch __export-neptune-to-kinesis-job__. These logs will indicate whether _neptune-export_ was successfully downloaded to the batch instance, and the progress of the export job. When reviewing the logs, ensure that:

  - _neptune-export_ has been successfully downloaded to the Batch compute instance
  - _neptune-export_ has successfully exported nodes and relationships from Neptune and published them to Kinesis
  
If your job is stuck in a RUNNABLE state, you may need to review the network and security settings for your AWS Batch compute environment. See __Verify the network and security settings of the compute environment__ in [this knowledge article](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/batch-job-stuck-runnable-status/).

To diagnose issues with the indexing of data in Amazon ElasticSearch, consult the Amazon CloudWatch logs for your __kinesis-to-elasticsearch__ AWS Lambda function. These logs will show the Lambda connecting to ElasticSearch, and will indicate how many records from the Kinesis Stream have been processed.
